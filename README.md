## Introduction

Grid-tie inverters play a crucial role in renewable energy systems. They convert direct current (DC) from solar panels into alternating current (AC) that can be fed into the electrical grid. This app simulates various grid-tie inverter scenarios, helping users understand performance, efficiency, and system behavior.

The simulation is designed for both beginners and experienced users. Whether you're a student, engineer, or hobbyist, this tool can enhance your understanding of grid-tie inverters.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application has an intuitive layout that makes navigation easy.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Experience real-time feedback as you adjust parameters.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Modify settings such as voltage, current, and frequency to see how they affect performance.
- **Data Visualization**: View graphs and charts that illustrate inverter performance.
- **Export Data**: Save your simulation results for further analysis.
- **Multi-Scenario Support**: Simulate different configurations and conditions to see how they impact efficiency.
